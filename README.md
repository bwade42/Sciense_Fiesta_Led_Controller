# Sciense_Fiesta_Led_Controller
A android application that controls Digital RGB Led Strips, by sending a string of commands from the App to a HTC 05 or HTC 06 bluetooth module that is wired to an Arduino Uno.

Some of the main features of the Application are:

1. Send a string of commands(specified in ardunio code) that will control the number of pixels that will light up, as well as the colors that will be displayed.

2. Uses an Android devices accelerometer, by allowing the user to click 'blast off' on the app, which gives the user 5 seconds to accelerate the tablet/phone in any direction as fast as they can, and after the 5 seconds are up the led strip will display an animation based upon the accumalated acceleration in the alloated time.

3. Led-Says tab still in development.
